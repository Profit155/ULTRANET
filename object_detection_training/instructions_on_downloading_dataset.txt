go to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mhGaH_riwpCnCgAmUJUP5gyW1e7zJ28n?usp=sharing
and download dataset_materials.zip

2:
extract dataset_materials.zip into the same folder as dataset_generator.ipynb (same folder as this txt file)

3:
run dataset_generator.ipynb, keep in mind that you might need to adjust some settings

4:
now make sure that a new folder appeared called auto_generated_dataset which contains training and validation data in the YOLO format

6:
clone the YOLOv5 repo and follow this tutorial to train the model

7:
inside targeting_sensor.py replace the path to the existing model with the path to your new model which you can find in
